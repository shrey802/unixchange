This repository contains a web app that is in the development stage. This is my first project & I'm thinking of building the MVP first (p0 features) and then add more features and do improvements.

# Tech stack used - 
React js, Firebase Web, CSS.

# What is unixchange?
-> A place to exchange your stuff (literally anything)!

# Features built- 
-> Edit profile. <br />

-> Get queries from users. <br />

-> Other minor features. <br />

-> Profile Picture.

# Features remaining - 
-> Post stuff (images, text, price). <br />
 
-> P2P payment integration and exchange logic (API yet to decide). <br />

# Features built but should be modified -
-> Google OAuth

# Issues - 
-> Responsiveness === false;

# You got Ideas?
-> Put it in the discussions of this repository.
